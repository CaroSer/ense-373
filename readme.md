# **Project Idea**

Our team will design and develop a web-based software application called "MediLocate" by utilizing software engineering management principles and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture/pattern.

# **Project Background and Business Opportunity**

Patients usually face difficulties when trying to find doctors or schedule appointments, mostly due to the necessity to use outdated systems and scattered information all around the web. Many medical institutions lack an efficient way for patients to search for the needed professionals, check availability, or book appointments seamlessly. MediLocate addresses these needs by offering a platform that not only enhances the patient experience but also empowers healthcare providers to manage their operations more effectively. This creates an opportunity to increase patient satisfaction, reduce appointment no-shows, and improve operational efficiencies for medical institutions
